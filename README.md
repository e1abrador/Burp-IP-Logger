## TL;DR

### Installation

Go to the Extensions -> Installed -> Add -> iptracker.py

### Why?

Usually in a red team engagement it is needed to log all IP addresses used in the exercise. By using this extension, Burp will log all IP addresses used automatically, so the auditor can focus on testing and stop caring about what IP address he has used.

## Using

Once the extension is loaded, it will start logging your IP address:

It will show the IP Address used + the first and last time the IP was detected. 

Good luck and good hunting!
